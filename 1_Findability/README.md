# 🏰 FAIR F — The Quest for Findability

Our journey begins in the great **FAIR Kingdom**, where whispers tell of a brilliant analyst, **Percival**, who vanished under mysterious circumstances. While investigating one of his old dashboards, you stumble upon a **working query**—but that’s not all he left behind...

There lies a **treasure chest of data**, buried beneath layers of spaghetti SQL and _zero_ documentation. 🤦‍♂️ The query works, sure—but without context, it’s like finding a treasure chest and forgetting where you buried it! 🏴‍☠️

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Your task is to make the data **FINDABLE**, so others can carry on where Percival left off.

Here’s what needs to be done:

- 📜 **Document** the model and all its columns.
- 🏷️ **Tag** the model for discoverability.
- 🔍 **Generate dbt docs** and try to find your model through search.

Let’s bring clarity to the chaos, so our kingdom can award the **Golden Dragon Coins** to our heroes! 🪙
