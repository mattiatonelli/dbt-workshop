# 🏰 The Mystery of the Missing Analyst in the FAIR Kingdom! 🧙‍♂️

Once upon a time in the **FAIR Kingdom**, we had a brilliant data analyst by the name of **Percival the Query Whisperer**. He could summon the most complex SQL spells and weave data into elegant answers faster than you could say **"SELECT \* FROM"**. 🧑‍💻✨

For weeks, Percival had been working diligently on our latest quest: finding the **top 3 citizens by number of quests completed**. As a reward, the **top citizens** were to be **awarded a special prize**: a **Golden Dragon Coin** 🪙 (only given to those truly worthy). It was going to be the **honor of a lifetime** for the three adventurers who topped the leaderboard. 🎖️

And then... **Percival went missing**. 😱 One day, he was sitting at his desk, typing away at his computer with a mug of hot cocoa, muttering something about “optimizing queries” and “removing unnecessary joins.” The next day, his desk was empty. No mug, no computer—just a single **document** named the **Holy Grail of Data Management: FAIR** 🌲.

Rumor has it that Percival was last seen **entering a tavern called "The Unoptimized Query"**, and since then, no one’s heard from him. 🕵️‍♂️

Now, here we are, holding the **query he left behind**, and it works! Yes, it gives us the **top 3 citizens** along with their **height** and **most used weapon**. **But...** we’re **not entirely sure** it’s correct. 🧐 The numbers look good, but something’s missing—maybe it's the magic of optimization? Or perhaps it’s a little too... **messy**?

The kingdom is eager to give out the **Golden Dragon Coins** to the top 3 adventurers, but we **dare not proceed** until we’re certain the query is **optimized** and **FAIR**.

That’s where you come in! 🚀

It’s time to **dust off the old queries**, use the **FAIR principles** (the secret document Percival left behind), and **enhance** this query to make sure the results are **findable, accessible, interoperable**, and **reusable** for future users! 🧙‍♀️

Are you ready to venture through the **mystical land of data optimization** and become the hero who **rescues the query** and ensures the **Golden Dragon Coins** are truly earned? 🏆

Now that the tale is set, we can begin our quest to make the query **FAIR** for the kingdom. The first task awaits—let’s make sure this query **shines**! ✨
