# 🏰 FAIR A — The Gates of Accessibility

By documenting everything and tagging the model properly, we’ve made our data findable! You’ve helped ensure that future adventurers will be able to assign the Golden Dragon Coin award without a hitch. 🏆

After Percival the Analyst's **disappearance**, rumors started flying across the kingdom. Some say he left to join a **bard rock band**, others say he simply couldn't handle another messy data folder named "final_final_really_final_v2". 📁🎸

Regardless, **we** now face a **new problem**:  
Even though the data is there, **nobody knows how to access it!** 🧹 The **Golden Dragon Coin** award is in jeopardy once again! It turns out that hiding information behind messy folder structures and unclear permissions is just as bad as losing it altogether. 🧙‍♂️🔒

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Thus, your task is to **open the Gates of ACCESSIBILITY**:

- Make sure the models are well-organized, not lost in some **data dungeon**.
- Define clear permissions: only the right heroes should touch the treasures!
- Use **views** when useful to avoid making every knight in the kingdom burn their computing budgets just to **look at** the data.
