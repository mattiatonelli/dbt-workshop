# 🏰 FAIR A — The Gates of Accessibility

Thanks to you, Percival’s legacy is no longer lost to the sands of undocumented queries. The models are tagged, described, and easily discoverable! 📖 But our adventure has only just begun...

Word is spreading fast: **Percival is still missing.** Some say he joined a traveling bard band. Others say he simply rage-quit after seeing one more CSV named `final_final_REAL_v5`. Whatever the case, we must press on.

Unfortunately, although the models now exist, **no one can actually access them!** The data is buried deep behind poor permissions and cryptic folder structures. It’s like guarding a royal archive with a dragon and forgetting where you left the keys! 🔒🐉

## 🎯 Your Quest:

It’s time to open the **Gates of ACCESSIBILITY**. Here’s what you must do:

- 🗂️ Organize the models into meaningful folders and structure.
- 🪞 Use **views** to ensure lightweight exploration of your data.

Let’s make sure who needs data access in the kingdom actually **can** do it — without burning through their entire compute budget! 🧾🔥
