# 🤔 **Need Some Guidance?**

If you're feeling lost in the **Gates of Accessibility**, here are some hints to help you:

- **Hint #1**:  
  Organize your models into folders named **bronze**, **silver**, and **gold**. Think of it like building your castle in three glorious stages: rough stone, polished marble, and golden towers. 🏰✨

- **Hint #2**:  
  Use `views` where you don’t need heavy compute. Views are like magical mirrors: you can look, but not touch the gold. 🪞
