# 🏆 **The Heroic Solution**

## 1. Use a Clean Model Folder Structure:

Create a folder structure like this inside your dbt project:

```
models/
├── bronze/
│   ├── staging_citizens.sql
│   ├── staging_quests.sql
│   └── staging_items.sql
├── silver/
│   ├── processed_citizens.sql
│   └── processed_quests.sql
└── gold/
    └── top_citizens.sql
```

This simple tree structure clearly shows the organization of your models across different stages: **bronze** for raw data, **silver** for transformed data, and **gold** for final, aggregated results. 🌟

## 2. Define User Permissions

Inside your `dbt_project.yml` grants folder-specific access to different roles:

```yaml
name: fair_kingdom
version: "1.0"
config-version: 2

models:
  fair_kingdom:
    bronze:
      +grants:
        select:
          - data_engineer_role
    silver:
      +grants:
        select:
          - data_analyst_role
    gold:
      +grants:
        select:
          - data_scientist_role
```

This allows specific users to query information across all model layers, while preventing unauthorized users to access them.

## 3. Use Views Where Needed

Update the `dbt_project.yml` by using the `materialized='view'` attribute for the gold layer. Views are lightweight, quick to build, and ideal for sharing without blowing up compute budgets. 💨

```yaml
name: fair_kingdom
version: "1.0"
config-version: 2

models:
  fair_kingdom:
    bronze:
      +grants:
        select:
          - analyst_role
    silver:
      +grants:
        select:
          - analyst_role
    gold:
      +materialized: view # <--
      +grants:
        select:
          - analyst_role
```
