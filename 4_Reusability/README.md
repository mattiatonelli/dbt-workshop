# 🏰 **R - The Code Refactor Quest**

You’ve successfully made your data interoperable, ensuring that no matter their origin, every kingdom's citizen will be able to easily read and utilize the source data. 🏆

But, it seems our mighty analyst, Percival, has left another trail of breadcrumbs! While we were able to track down **Percival’s missing data**, we’ve run into a new problem. 😱 **The code is messy**. We've got **repetitive logic** everywhere, and a few more issues that need to be tackled in order to make the kingdom’s data more **maintainable** and **robust**.

Let’s face it—**copy-pasting** code is not the way to create a **sustainable future** for the kingdom. The **citizens' data** and **quests** have to be structured more efficiently, **cleaned up**, and **tested** before we proceed with new heroic tasks!

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Here’s what needs to be done:

- **Refactor repetitive logic** by using `ref()` for **all tables**.
- **Consolidate** the logic for handling **dates** into a reusable dbt model or macro.
- **Implement source freshness tests** to ensure the data is up to date.

Let’s make sure we keep our code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and our data fresh like the morning dew! 🍃💎
