# 🏰 FAIR R — The Code Refactor Quest

Victory is near! Your efforts have made the kingdom’s data **findable**, **accessible**, and **interoperable**. 🏆 And now… a new message appears.

Buried inside an old macro, you find a **cryptic note** from Percival himself:

> “Too many duplicates. Too many conversions. If anyone finds this, don’t repeat my mistakes... and stop repeating your logic!”

Suddenly, the truth is clear: Percival didn’t vanish—he went underground to refactor the kingdom’s entire data stack. But he left behind a final test to determine who is worthy to carry on his mission. The kingdom’s future rests on your ability to clean up his messy trail. 🧹

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Your task is to bring **REUSABILITY** to the kingdom and finally finish what Percival started:

- 🧩 Simplify calling tables across models.
- 🌀 Extract **repetitive date transformation logic** into a macro.
- ⏱️ Implement tests to ensure the data doesn’t get stale.

Let’s write once, reuse everywhere, and ensure our data is always fresh like the mountain air of Mount Refactor! When this quest is complete, you may just uncover Percival’s final location... 🧙‍♂️📍
