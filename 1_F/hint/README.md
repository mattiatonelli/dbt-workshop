# 🤔 **Need Some Guidance?**

If you're feeling lost in the **Forest of Findability**, here are some hints to help you:

- **Hint #1**: You need to use the `schema.yml` file to add **documentation** to the model and its columns. Think of this like labeling your treasure chest so you’ll know what’s inside later. 📦

- **Hint #2**: To make your model easy to search for later, use the `tags` field in your `schema.yml`. A tag like **"citizens"** or **"quests"** will help future adventurers (or analysts) categorize your work. 🏷️

- **Hint #3**: Don’t forget to run `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve` to see your documentation come to life! This will let you view all your work in a **beautiful web interface**—like a map that shows the way to treasure. 🌐

- **Hint #4**: Remember: **document everything**! If there’s a column related to **height**, make sure you explain what that means in the context of the quest. If it's related to **quests**, explain what it tracks.
