# 🏰 FAIR F — The Quest for Findability

As we continue our journey through the **FAIR Kingdom**, it turns out our missing analyst, Percival, didn’t leave just a **working query**. He also left behind a **treasure chest of documentation**—or rather, the **lack of it**. 😅

You see, our top 3 citizens by number of quests are **now discoverable** in the query, but there’s a **problem**: we have no idea **how to find** this information again later. The query is great and all, but without proper **documentation** and **tags**, it’s like finding a treasure chest but forgetting where you buried it! 🏴‍☠️

Your task is to **make this query FINDABLE**, just like the **Golden Dragon Coin** hidden in the kingdom! 🪙

Here’s what needs to be done:

- **Document** the model and its columns.
- **Tag** the model for easier categorization (let’s make sure it's tagged in a relevant manner).
- Use **dbt docs** to generate documentation and check it out! 📜

Only then will we be able to find it later, even if we’re still wandering around trying to find Percival in the **Forest of Unused Code**. 🌲

Are you ready to help the kingdom become more **findable**? Let’s make sure the **Golden Dragon Coins** can be awarded to our heroes!
