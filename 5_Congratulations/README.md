# 🎉 The Return of Percival — A Hero's Welcome!

Trumpets sound across the FAIR Kingdom! 🎺🎉 After completing the legendary four FAIR quests—**Findability**, **Accessibility**, **Interoperability**, and **Reusability**—you have done the impossible...

You have found **Percival**. 🧙‍♂️

Deep beneath the ancient Data Vaults, tucked inside a forgotten staging schema, Percival had been **refactoring the entire kingdom’s pipelines by hand**, one `SELECT *` at a time. Why? Because he believed in a better world—one with **clean models**, **fresh sources**, and **no duplicated date logic**. ✨

And now, thanks to your heroic efforts, his work is finally complete.

Percival emerges blinking into the daylight, holding a single `.sql` scroll. He nods at you solemnly and says:

> “You’ve done well, analyst. The data flows freely, the documentation is rich, and the DAGs are clean. The kingdom is in good hands.”

A feast is held in your honor. 🏰🍗 The people cheer. The dragons throw confetti. And from this day forward, your name will be etched in the dbt docs under:

> `contributors: ["You, the True Data Champion"]`

Go forth, FAIR Knight of Data. You’ve earned your Golden Dragon Coin. 🪙👑
