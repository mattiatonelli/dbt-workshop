# 🤔 **Need Some Guidance?**

If you're feeling lost in the **Interoperability Trials**, here are some hints to help you:

- **Hint #1**:  
  Use **dbt sources** to standardize your data coming from multiple realms (a.k.a. tables). This ensures that all your raw data is treated with respect and aligns with the kingdom's standards. 📜

- **Hint #2**:  
  Apply the **ISO 8601 date format and metric system** across all models to avoid confusion. 🗓️

- **Hint #3**:  
  Use `dbt tests` to make sure the data is in tip-top shape — no **NULLs** where there shouldn’t be any and **unique** identifiers for citizens and quests. 🧙‍♂️
