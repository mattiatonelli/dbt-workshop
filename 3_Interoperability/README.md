# 🏰 FAIR I — The Interoperability Trials

With your help, the data is now both **findable** and **accessible**! Legends say that Percival was last seen near the **Forest of Format Confusion**, trying to standardize a dataset that listed birthdays in **seven different formats**. 😨

Our kingdom is so vast and diverse that **different dialects** have evolved in various regions. For example, as for dates, the **High Wizards** of the East insist on the **ISO 8601** format (`yyyy-mm-dd`), while the citizens of the **Southern Isles** still prefer their dates in the `dd/mm/yyyy` style. Some use the **metric systems** while others the **imperial** one. And let's not even get started on how they handle NULL values! 😱

Luckily, there is an **official language** in the kingdom that everybody understands! So, it's time to **standardize our data** and make it speak the **official language** of the kingdom. Only then can we make sure that adventurers from all realms understand our magical datasets without confusion. 🗣️✨

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Now, his unfinished mission has fallen to you, so make the data **INTEROPERABLE** for all corners of the kingdom:

- 🧱 Make sure models can consistently pull from standardized **sources**.
- 📐 Align naming conventions, date formats, and units of measurement.
- ✅ Add constraints (like `citizen_id` must be **not null** and **unique**) to ensure consistency.

By making our models speak a common language, you’ll empower analysts from all provinces to collaborate without confusion—and perhaps bring us one step closer to finding Percival. 🌍📊
