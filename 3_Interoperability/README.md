# 🧙‍♀️ FAIR I — Interoperable

With the kingdom’s gates wide open and the data easily accessible to the authorized users, we are one step closer to ensuring that the **Golden Dragon Coin** prize is awarded to those truly deserving it! 🏰

But the journey doesn’t end here!  
Our kingdom is so vast and diverse that **different dialects** have evolved in various regions. For example, as for dates, the **High Wizards** of the East insist on the **ISO 8601** format (`yyyy-mm-dd`), while the citizens of the **Southern Isles** still prefer their dates in the `dd/mm/yyyy` style. Some use the **metric systems** while others the **imperial** one. And let's not even get started on how they handle NULL values! 😱

Luckily, there is an **official language** in the kingdom that everybody understands! So, it's time to **standardize our data** and make it speak the **official language** of the kingdom. Only then can we make sure that adventurers from all realms understand our magical datasets without confusion. 🗣️✨

## 🎯 Your Quest:

Your task is to **make our data INTEROPERABLE** — just like the Golden Dragon Coin that awaits the worthy adventurer! 🪙

Here’s what needs to be done TO ensure all incoming data speaks the kingdom's language:

- Standardize the data access to different tables/views.
- Align the standards used across all the models.
- Ensure the columns `citizen_id` and `quest_id` follow our kingdom's rules (no NULLs and uniqueness, of course).

By completing these steps, you’ll ensure that all different kingdom's inhabitants can **easily understand and employ** the data without the risk of misinterpretation. 🎉
